This is my casual game. It's type a classical "Bubbles" but in the space. A lot of asteroids move on the screen. You can make an explosion, which stays on the screen some times. After it has disappeared. If an asteroid collides with an explosion, an asteroid becomes invisible and a new explosion has created.
The game will end when every explosion becomes invisible.
I developed this game using C++.
